# Bookmarks Parsing Python Script

## What Each File Is...

- main.py is the main python file, once the whole project is done, this should be the only nessecary file.

- all the other files ending in .py will be used in that main.py file, if one component their names may give hints to what needs debugging.

- the bookmarks.csv is the bookmarks.html cleaned and turned to csv in one.
- the night_tab.csv is the night_tab.json cleaned and turned to csv in one.

This README.md is so people like me and you can remember what the fuck this whole thing means when we move onto another project and forget about all of this.

Ummmmmm. I started using ur code but got rid of alot of it lol. Python for life ðŸ˜Ž

# CSV to Web

Turning the csv generated from the process before (firefox bookmarks to csv and nighttab bookmarks to csv) and using those combined csv files as data to flow into a webpage as their bookmarks under their categories.

For the website I want a focus to be on integrating the python script into it and being able to edit how folders look and interact. With a focus on the data handling and how users can import more data if they wish and formatting data themselves as they please.

## Chosen API's / extra code

- Read CSV data with JavaScript/TypeScript and store in an array/object
- Create HTML elements dynamically for each bookmark with a loop
- Use a third-party API like RealFaviconGenerator to generate a favicon for each bookmark
- https://github.com/RealFaviconGenerator/rfg-api
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/

---

- Use a consistent color scheme and font
- CSS transitions and hover effects
