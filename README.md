# Bookmarks Parsing Python Script

## What Each File Is...

- main.py is the main python file, once the whole project is done, this should be the only nessecary file.

- all the other files ending in .py will be used in that main.py file, if one component their names may give hints to what needs debugging.

- the bookmarks.csv is the bookmarks.html cleaned and turned to csv in one.
- the night_tab.csv is the night_tab.json cleaned and turned to csv in one.

This README.md is so people like me and you can remember what the fuck this whole thing means when we move onto another project and forget about all of this.

Ummmmmm. I started using ur code but got rid of alot of it lol. Python for life :cool
